- I might consider integrating a Tweet sending option to this.
    - And more probably something to my own blog (TextPattern with XML-RPC)
- Listings
    - column selection for csv and compact?!
    - date based filters
    - html report output
    - when sorting by ratings or movie names, we should merge watches of the
      same fil. Avg the ratings.
- Make moary look up the env variables for MOVIEDB. That'll be the unix way.
- One way to simplify our mess: make ``args.imdb`` a function (pointing either
  to ensure_good_imdb_id_interactive or something else.)
    - not that good a solution since there are different usecases for
      args.imdb.
