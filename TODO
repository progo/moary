- I might consider integrating a Tweet sending option to this.
    - And more probably something to my own blog (TextPattern with XML-RPC)
- Edit subcommand
    - 'moary edit' will edit the last one
- Listings
    - compact list form
    - CSV, column selection
    - expanded list form with titles, imdb urls and messages, cookiejar format
    - grep of course
