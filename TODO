- I might consider integrating a Tweet sending option to this.
    - And more probably something to my own blog (TextPattern with XML-RPC)
- Listings
    - column selection for csv and compact?!
    - date based filters
    - html report output
    - when sorting by ratings or movie names, we should merge watches of the

- add entries with the IMDB id.
    - no movie name then needed.
