- I might consider integrating a Tweet sending option to this.
    - And more probably something to my own blog (TextPattern with XML-RPC)
- Listings
    - column selection for csv and compact?!
    - date based filters
    - html report output
    - when sorting by ratings or movie names, we should merge watches of the
      same film. Avg the ratings.
- Make moary look up the env variables for MOVIEDB. That'll be the unix way.
- When no message present, don't print the empty line in full listings.
- Force fillouts: run messages into long lines if not already and store it that
  way. (Split by '\n\n' into paragraphs and then map `replace('\n', ' ')`.)
  When printing, do split('\n\n') and map fill and println to each.
- Query IMDB to print a random bit of trivia about the movie after inserted.
  (Of course skip that if going batch or the IMDB has been given already.)
